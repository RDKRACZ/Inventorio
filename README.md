## Features 
#### Toolbelt
Instead of taking space in the Hotbar, tools are now stored in their own place.
When you mine a block, a correct tool gets passively applied from the said Toolbelt.
* Mending will mend tools in the Toolbelt before going into player's XP bar
* Axe will be used as a melee weapon in the sword slot is empty
* Hoe Toolbelt slot accepts shears. Sword Toolbelt slot accepts Trident.
* Toolbelt slots accept modded tools as long as they inherit from vanilla tool classes.

#### Utility Belt
An Offhand replacement with a dedicated hotbar of 4 slots that can be scrolled through independently, and which skips the empty slots.
You can use the selected Utility independently, which allows you to akimbo two types of blocks or two types of usable items.

#### Deep Pockets Enchantment
Each level of this enchantment adds an additional row to your inventory, up to 3 at max level.
In addition, the first level adds 4 extra slots to the Utility Belt (from 4 to 8)

#### Increased Ender Chest Capacity
The capacity of the Ender Chest has been doubled.
This can be disabled in the server-wide config, but you need to distribute the said config to all players if you edit it.

#### Infinity Bow Requires No Arrow
This mod fixes a Vanilla bug when you need an arrow to use the Infinity Bow.

#### Totems of Undying activate from the Utility Belt
Instead of being permanently stuck in the offhand, it will go off from any of 4 (8 with Deep Pockets) Utility Belt slots.

### Player Settings
#### Segmented Hotbar
Accessing slots after 5 with a keyboard might be cumbersome because the keys are just too far away. This feature makes the first keystroke select a section, and the second keystroke will select an item inside that section.

There's a "Visual Only" option that keeps the default selection schema.

#### Firework Rocket Boost Button
A dedicated button to fire a boost rocket directly from your inventory while flying. Can be co-bound to Jump.

#### Trident Loyalty Check 
This option prevents you from throwing a Trident without Loyalty.

#### "Use Item" Applies To Offhand
The original idea was to bind each hand to its own dedicated button, but some people found it confusing, and this option restores the vanilla behavior of vanilla "Use Item", while "Use Utility" applies only to the Utility Belt / Offhand.     

#### Skip Empty Utility Slots 
By default, scrolling and displaying the Utility Belt skips the empty slots, but you can set this behavior to false. There's also a keybind (not bound by default) that allows to scroll to the first empty Utility Belt slot.   

#### Rebind Scroll Wheel to the Utility Belt
You can rebind the Scroll Wheel to scroll through the Utility Belt, while using the number keys to chose from the Hotbar slots.   

#### Swapped Hands
This option allows to assign the vanilla Hotbar to your Offhand, and the Utility Belt to your Main Hand.

## Global Settings
To improve mod compatibility, some features can be disabled on a game-wide level for all players. 

Global settings can be accessed by a keybind (only in a single player world) or directly at `%root_folder%/config/inventorio_shared.json`. 

Joining a server (either dedicated or hosted from another client) with mismatching global settings will prompt a request to sync your settings and restart the game, but sharing the config beforehand is recommended.

* `ExpandedEnderChest (default: true)` - when set to false, disables mixins responsible for increasing Ender Chest capacity.<br/>
* `InfinityBowNeedsNoArrow (default: true)` - when set to false, disables mixins responsible for Infinity Bow requiring no arrows.<br/>
* `TotemFromUtilityBelt (default: true)` - when set to false, disables mixins responsible for Totem of Undying going off from any Utility Belt slot.<br/>
* `AllowSwappedHands (default: true)` - when set to false, removes the option to [Swap Hands](#swapped-hands).<br/>

* `ToolBeltMode (default: ENABLED)` -  Allows to disable the Toolbelt a)completely b)allow only the Toolbelt slots added by other mods<br/>
* `UtilityBeltShortDefaultSize (default: true)` - By default, the Deep Pockets Enchantment increases the Utility Belt capacity from 4 to 8. When set to false, the full capacity is given unconditionally.<br/>
* `DeepPocketsInTreasures (default: true)` - Can a Deep Pockets Book be obtained in treasure chests<br/>
* `DeepPocketsInTrades (default: true)` - Can a Deep Pockets Book be obtained in a villager trade<br/>
* `DeepPocketsInRandomSelection (default: true)` - Can a Deep Pockets Book be obtained in random selection (Enchanting Table and mob loot)

## Feedback, Use in Modpacks and Mod Compatibility
Feel free to use this mod in a modpack.

If you encounter bugs or compatibility issues with other mods, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Lizard-Of-Oz/Inventorio/issues).

If you want to request a feature or modification, please use an Issue Tracker or make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Lizard-Of-Oz/Inventorio/pulls).  

## Inventorio as a Dependency for Your Mod
The structure of this mod can be considered stable - I have some plans for future updates, but Inventorio is mostly in the life support mode - it will get ported to future versions of Minecraft, but with the bare minimum changes required.  

If you want to use this mode as a dependency, I recommend using JitPack as described below.<br/>
Please note that me using Architectury plugin causes the gradle setup to be different that usual: 

Fabric:
```
repositories {
  ...
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
  ...
  modCompileOnly ('com.github.Lizard-Of-Oz.Inventorio:inventorio-1.17-fabric:1.17-SNAPSHOT') { transitive = false }
}
```

Forge:
```
repositories {
  ...
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
  ...
  compileOnly ('com.github.Lizard-Of-Oz.Inventorio:inventorio-1.17-forge:1.17-SNAPSHOT') { transitive = false }
}
```

Note: I haven't figured out how to include documentation into the jar file generated by JitPack. Please read the [source code of InventorioAPI](https://github.com/Lizard-Of-Oz/Inventorio/blob/1.17/common/src/main/java/me/lizardofoz/inventorio/api/InventorioAPI.java)

### Addon Slots, Toolbelt & Item Tags
`InventorioAPI` allows your mod to add custom Toolbelt slots and add custom allowing and disallowing tags and conditions to toolbelt slots, including existing ones.

Note: when working with the Toolbelt, please consider that its size may vary depending on the mods and settings installed.<br> 
Don't assume any particular size of the Toolbelt or the slot order across multiple play sessions. ToolBelt size is the same for all players within the same play session.<br>
Slot indices of the Deep Pockets and the Utility Belt are persistent.

Please use `InventorioAPI#findFittingToolBeltStack` to find a Toolbelt slot that can accept an item and don't assume any persistent index.

<br/>

By default, any tool inheriting its Java class from a vanilla tool (e.g. `PickaxeItem.java`) will be accepted by a corresponding slot.

Any tool with an [item tag](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:tags) `inventorio:%item_type%` will be accepted by a corresponding slot.

You can blacklist a tool from the Toolbelt slot by adding giving it a tag `inventorio:%item_type%_blacklist`.

In Forge, a slot accepts any item with a corresponding [ToolType](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/items/items/#basic-items).

In Fabric, `fabric:%item_type%` item tag is accepted by a corresponding slot.

Any custom filters and tags can be added via `InventorioAPI`

Note: `%item_type%` is always spelled in plural. Available item types: `pickaxes`, `swords`, `axes`, `shovels`, `hoes`.

Note: Please ignore `InventorioModIntegration` and `ModIntegration` - they're intended for INVENTORIO to integrate with other mods, NOT for other mods to integrate with Inventorio.

## ~~(Somewhat) Confirmed Compatible Mods~~

Mod compatibility has drained my soul, as more often than not it's a problem on their end, and they don't provide an API to work with it.

But you're still welcome to use the Issue Tracker. Maybe your problem can indeed be solved with one line of code, who knows?

That said, [1.16 Version](https://github.com/Lizard-Of-Oz/Inventorio/tree/1.16) has some "(somewhat) compatible mods".
